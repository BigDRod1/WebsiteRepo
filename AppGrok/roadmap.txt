Roadmap for Building the Marketing Questionnaire App
Phase 1: Initial Setup and Core UI
This phase sets up the foundation and builds the basic user interface.
Task 1: Set up the development environment
Choose a tech stack, such as React Native for cross-platform mobile development (works on both iOS and Android).
Install necessary tools: 
Node.js (JavaScript runtime).
Expo CLI (for React Native development and testing).
A code editor like Visual Studio Code.
Run npx create-expo-app MarketingQuestionnaireApp to create the project.
Set up version control with Git: Initialize a repository (git init) and push it to a remote service like GitHub.
Task 2: Design the basic UI layout
Sketch wireframes for key screens: 
Question List (home screen with a list of questions).
Answer Screen (where users respond to questions).
Settings (user preferences).
Get Paid (earnings and withdrawal options).
In your project, create a bottom navigation panel with icons/labels for Answer, Settings, and Get Paid using a library like react-navigation.
Apply a clean design with a light background, readable fonts, and consistent button styles.
Task 3: Implement the Question List screen
In the main screen file (e.g., HomeScreen.js), use a FlatList component to display a scrollable list of placeholder questions (e.g., "What’s your favorite color?").
Add a balance widget in the top right corner with static text (e.g., "$0.00") using a Text component inside a View with styling.
Phase 2: User Flow - Answering Questions
This phase enables users to answer questions and see their balance update.
Task 4: Develop the Answer feature
Make each question in the FlatList clickable, navigating to an AnswerScreen.js file using navigation.navigate('Answer').
In AnswerScreen.js, display the selected question and add response options (e.g., a TextInput for text answers or buttons for multiple choice).
Task 5: Add submission functionality
Add a "Submit" button below the response input in AnswerScreen.js.
On button press, show an alert (e.g., Alert.alert("Success", "Answer submitted successfully")) and return the user to the Question List screen.
Task 6: Integrate the balance system
Use a state management tool like useState or Redux to track the user’s balance (start at $0.00).
After a successful submission in Task 5, increase the balance by a fixed amount (e.g., $0.10) and update the balance widget on the Question List screen.
Phase 3: Settings and Customer Opt-In
This phase adds user settings and the ability to become a customer.
Task 7: Build the Settings screen
Create a SettingsScreen.js file accessible from the bottom navigation.
Add simple options like a notification toggle (using a Switch component) and a "Become a Customer" button.
Task 8: Implement customer opt-in functionality
On pressing "Become a Customer," update the app state to mark the user as a customer (e.g., set isCustomer: true in state).
Dynamically add an Ask option to the bottom navigation panel by updating the navigation configuration when isCustomer is true.
Phase 4: Customer Flow - Posting Content
This phase allows customers to create and pay for posts.
Task 9: Develop the Ask feature
Create an AskScreen.js file accessible via the "Ask" navigation option.
Build a form with:
TextInput for question text.
Dropdown or radio buttons for response type (e.g., text, multiple choice).
TextInput for payment terms (e.g., "$0.05 per response").
Add a "Post" button to submit the form.
Task 10: Implement payment processing for customers
Install a payment library like stripe/stripe-react-native.
Before posting, prompt the customer to enter payment details using Stripe’s UI components.
On successful payment, save the post details locally or in a database and show a confirmation message.
Phase 5: Response Collection and Management
This phase enables customers to manage responses.
Task 11: Build the response collection system
Set up a backend database (e.g., Firebase Firestore) to store responses.
After a user submits an answer (Task 5), save it to the database with the question ID and user ID.
In AskScreen.js, add a section to fetch and display responses for the customer’s posts.
Task 12: Add analytics features
In the response display section, show a basic count (e.g., "Responses: 10") using a Text component.
Add a button to download responses as a CSV file using a library like react-native-fs.
Phase 6: Payment System for Users
This phase handles user earnings and payouts.
Task 13: Implement user earnings management
In GetPaidScreen.js, display the current balance and a list of past earnings (e.g., "$0.10 - 10/01/2023").
Store earnings history in local state or the database.
Task 14: Develop the Get Paid feature
Add a "Request Withdrawal" button in GetPaidScreen.js.
Set a minimum threshold (e.g., $5) and check if the balance meets it before enabling the button.
Integrate the payment gateway (e.g., PayPal API) to process payouts manually or automatically.
Phase 7: Authenticity and Security Measures
This phase ensures real users and secure data.
Task 15: Add user verification
During app startup, show a registration screen with email or phone input.
Use Firebase Authentication to send a verification email or SMS code.
Add a CAPTCHA (e.g., via react-native-recaptcha) on the Answer Screen before submission.
Task 16: Ensure data security
Encrypt sensitive data like payment details using HTTPS for API calls.
Anonymize responses in the database (e.g., store user IDs instead of names).
Review compliance with privacy laws like GDPR or CCPA.
Phase 8: Testing and Optimization
This phase ensures the app works well and performs efficiently.
Task 17: Conduct thorough testing
Test on iOS and Android simulators using Expo (npx expo start).
Manually test each feature (e.g., answering questions, posting as a customer).
Fix bugs like navigation errors or UI glitches.
Task 18: Optimize performance
Use React.memo or useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
Add pagination to the Question List (e.g., load 10 questions at a time) using FlatList’s onEndReached.
Test load times with dummy data and optimize slow database queries.
Phase 9: Deployment
This phase launches the app to the public.
Task 19: Prepare for deployment
Set up a production backend (e.g., Firebase or AWS).
Switch the payment gateway to live mode (update API keys in Stripe/PayPal).
Build the app for production with npx expo build:android and npx expo build:ios.
Task 20: Launch the app
Submit the app to Google Play Store and Apple App Store via their developer consoles.
Monitor crash reports and user feedback using tools like Expo’s dashboard.
Release quick updates for any critical issues post-launch.
Conclusion
This roadmap provides clear, actionable steps to build the Marketing Questionnaire App from scratch to deployment. By following these tasks one at a time, you’ll create a functional app with a user-friendly interface, secure payments, and robust features for both users and customers. Start with Task 1 and work your way through—happy coding!
