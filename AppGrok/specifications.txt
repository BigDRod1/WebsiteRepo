Marketing Questionnaire App Specifications
Overview
The Marketing Questionnaire App is a platform where customers can post questions, ads, or forms to collect responses from users, who are incentivized to answer with small monetary rewards. The core goal is to guarantee that responses come from real people, providing authentic and valuable data to customers. The app must be clean, visually appealing, and intuitive to ensure high user engagement and satisfaction.
User Roles
Users: Individuals who answer questions and earn small rewards per response.
Customers: Individuals or entities who pay to post questions, ads, or forms and collect responses from users.
Key Features
1. User Interface
Design: Clean, visually appealing, and user-friendly to enhance engagement.
Bottom Panel Options:
Answer: Displays a list of questions for users to respond to.
Settings: Allows app configuration, including an option to become a customer.
Get Paid: Enables users to view their earnings and request withdrawals.
Ask (for customers only): Appears after a user opts to become a customer, allowing them to post questions, ads, or forms.
Top Right Widget: A small, real-time display of the user’s current balance, which increases with each submitted answer.
2. User Flow
Initial Screen: Upon opening the app, users immediately see a scrollable list of available questions.
Answering Questions:
Select a question from the list via the Answer option.
Provide a response (e.g., text, multiple choice, depending on question type).
Submit the answer by clicking a Submit button or scrolling down to a submit area.
Reward System: Each submitted answer increases the user’s balance, reflected in the top right widget.
Becoming a Customer: 
Navigate to Settings.
Select an option to become a customer, which adds the Ask option to the bottom panel.
3. Customer Flow
Accessing Customer Features: Users opt to become customers via Settings, unlocking the Ask option.
Posting Content:
Use the Ask option to create questions, ads, or forms.
Input details such as question text, response type (e.g., multiple choice, open-ended), and payment terms (e.g., per response or per post).
Submit the post after payment is confirmed.
Response Collection: View and analyze responses to posted content, with options for summaries or raw data export.
4. Payment System
User Earnings: Users receive a small dollar reward for each submitted answer.
Customer Payments: Customers pay to post questions, ads, or forms, with pricing based on per-response or per-post models.
Implementation: Integrate a secure payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle transactions, including user withdrawals and customer deposits.
5. Response Authenticity
Goal: Ensure all responses are from real people, a key selling point of the app.
Measures:
User verification during registration (e.g., email or phone confirmation).
CAPTCHA or similar anti-bot checks during question submission.
Optional moderation of user accounts or responses to detect suspicious activity.

Technical Considerations
Scalability: The app must support a growing number of users, customers, questions, and responses without performance degradation.
Use scalable cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Firebase) and optimize database queries.
Database Management: Store questions, responses, user profiles, and payment records efficiently.
Consider NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB) for flexibility with unstructured response data.
Payment Integration: Ensure secure, reliable transaction processing.
Handle microtransactions efficiently, possibly with batch payouts to reduce fees.
User Experience: Minimize friction in navigation and submission processes.
Fast load times, intuitive layouts, and clear feedback (e.g., “Answer submitted”).
Data Security: Protect user data and responses.
Use encryption for sensitive data, comply with GDPR/CCPA, and limit data retention.
Potential Challenges and Solutions
1. User Engagement
Challenge: Maintaining user interest in answering questions over time.
Solution: 
Offer competitive rewards (e.g., $0.05-$0.50 per answer, adjustable based on budget).
Add gamification (e.g., streaks, badges).
Curate relevant or interesting questions.
2. Question Quality
Challenge: Preventing spam, irrelevant, or inappropriate questions from customers.
Solution: 
Implement a moderation queue for new posts.
Allow users to report problematic content.
3. Response Quality
Challenge: Ensuring users provide thoughtful answers rather than random inputs for rewards.
Solution: 
Set minimum response lengths for text answers.
Use random quality checks or allow customers to rate responses.
Penalize low-effort users (e.g., temporary bans).
4. Payment Handling
Challenge: Managing small transactions cost-effectively.
Solution: 
Set a minimum withdrawal threshold (e.g., $5) for users.
Use batch processing for payouts to reduce fees.
5. Scalability
Challenge: Handling high traffic or large datasets.
Solution: 
Deploy load balancers and auto-scaling servers.
Optimize database indexing for question retrieval and response storage.
6. Data Privacy
Challenge: Safeguarding user and customer data.
Solution: 
Encrypt data in transit and at rest.
Provide clear privacy policies and consent options.
Anonymize responses where possible.
7. Customer Support
Challenge: Addressing user or customer issues (e.g., payment disputes, app bugs).
Solution: 
Include an in-app support chat or ticket system.
Offer FAQs and troubleshooting guides.
